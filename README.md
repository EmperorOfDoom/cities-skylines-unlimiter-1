# Lifting some of Cities: Skylines' limits (ideally)

This is a work in progress and is not polished.

The following things work
* Buying and viewing tiles outside of the default 5x5 grid
* Placing roads, electricity poles and water pipes in all grids; although visual effects for the latter two may not display
* Placing free-standing buildings that do not need road access, such as water towers

Currently in development:

* Water, Electricity, Ploppables
* Notificationmanager is able to group notifications to be rendered from afar, but that only seems to work for the "default" grid size
